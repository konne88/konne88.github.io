HoTTSQL: Proving Query Rewrites with Univalent SQL Semantics
------------------------------------------------------------

SQL is the lingua franca for retrieving structured data. Existing semantics for
SQL, however, either do not model crucial features of the language (e.g.,
relational algebra lacks bag semantics, correlated subqueries, and aggregation),
or make it hard to formally reason about SQL query rewrites (e.g., the SQL
standard’s English is too informal). This post focuses on the ways that HoTT
concepts (e.g., Homotopy Types, the Univalence Axiom, and Truncation) enabled us
to develop HoTTSQL — a new SQL semantics that makes it easy to formally reason
about SQL query rewrites. Our paper also details the rich set of SQL features
supported by HoTTSQL.
